This is the homework. There are three tasks to complete, so you may choose one.

**Homework time:** Invest approx. 30 minutes

## Add meaningful, translated titles to your routes

Fix the titles in your app (Flo already started this - so maybe he should finish it ;-)).

### Bonus: Add aria-current to route anchors in the sidebar nav

A non-null [aria-current](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-current) state on an element indicates the current route link. Read more in this [lab](https://github.com/L-X-T/ng-b357/blob/main/labs/22_angular-router.md#set-aria-current-to-page-in-the-sidebar-nav).

## Check semantic tags and anchors

Check the usage of semantic tags in your app. Is there anything to improve?

Also, look at your navigation and make it use the correct anchors for the links. Read more in this [lab](https://github.com/L-X-T/ng-b357/blob/main/labs/23_semantic-html-structure.md#links-with-click-vs-href).

### Bonus: Fix headings order

Fix the headings order in your app and add global styling classes for the font-size (and other styles).

## Make your app navigable with the keyboard

Try to navigate through your app with the keyboard. Do you see any issues?

Fix the issues and include a proper focus indicator for the active element.

### Bonus: Add a skip link

Use a similar approach as in the previous [lab](https://github.com/L-X-T/ng-b357/blob/main/labs/24_keyboard-nav-tab-focus.md#bonus-create-a-skip-link) to add a skip link to your app.
